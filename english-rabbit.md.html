作宾语补语：
_The wolf saw the rabbit eating a carrot._ // 强调正在进行

作状语：
_Hearing the news, the rabbit became excited._ // 表时间

高级用法：
_The weather permitting, the rabbit will go out._ // 独立主格，这是个简单句，只有一个谓语动词 go，等同于 _If the weather permits, the rabbit will go out._

## 过去分词
动词+ed，大多作形容词用，有被动含义

作定语：
_The rabbit will eat minced carrot next week._

名词/代词 + 名词: 可以认为是 + 省略的 being (现在分词)
