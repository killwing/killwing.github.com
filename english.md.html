_Never does she make mistakes._
_Hardly had they sent out when it began to rain._

only引导状语在句首: _Only yesterday did I learn this._

not only ... but also引导非主语: _Not only does she like English but also works hard at it._

so ... that/such ... that/so + adj. + 倒装: _Such a nice girl is she that we all like her._

So do I!
so + 主 + 助：证实，重复，确定
so + 助 + 主：情况相同（肯）
neither/nor + 助 + 主：情况相同（否）
so it is(was) with ... 用于动词/肯否/主语不一致
_I get up late and was late for school. So it was with her. (It was the same with her.)_

as引导让步状语从句，解释为"虽然"必倒装: _Though he is a child, he knows a lot. -> ~~A~~ Child as he is, he knows a lot._

常用副词，形容词在句首，要倒装
only, so, thus, often, well, in, up, round, away, back, over, indead, many a time, to such a degree/an extent
_Often does he ask his teacher questions._
_Cold is the north wind._


## 复合句
### 名词从句
完整陈述句 - that：不作成分，无意义，不作介词宾语，在宾从中可省
_She told us that she had married a foreiner and that she would go abroad._
_I'm afraid that he won't come tomorrow._

特殊疑问 - wh*: 作成分，有意义，可作介宾，不用that引导，不可省
_I don't know when he came back yesterday._
_It surprised us that what he said was so interesting._

一般疑问句，选择疑问句 - whether, if(引导否定宾语从句)
不解释为如果，意为是否，只用whether: 句首，介宾，表从，后有or ... not
_My question is whether he can do it._

语序(总是S+V)
陈述
What's going on/What's the matter/What's wrong 意为有毛病，不调整语序
Wh* do you think/believe + 陈述(wh*为非主语)
It is ... that ...?/Wh* is it that ... ?

时态
主句一般现在时，从句任一，不能2级跳
主句一般过去时，从句为过去某一时态
客观真理，一般现在时
直接->间接，加"过去"

that/whether
that - 定: _It's certain that you will win._
whether - 未定: _He didn't tell us whether he would do it or not._

what/which
what - 具体内容
which - 不涉及内容，指代

what/that
what 作成分: _What he said ~~that~~ at the meeting surprised us._
that 不作成分: _That he said that at the meeting surprised us._

who(m)/who(m)ever 主宾看在从句中的成分
who 主，指事 _I don't care who will teach us._
whoever 主，指人=anyone who _Whoever you are must obey the rule._
wh*ever 强调，无论... 引导名从或让步状从
no matter wh* 强调，无论... 只引导让步状从(无条件状从)

wh*可直接当介词宾语, that在介词后形成固定搭配: in that(因为), but that(只是), except that(除了)

what可相当于as起连接作用: _Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body._

### 定语从句
由关代关副引导，必须是主句有所指，从句作成分，本身无意义，做宾语时可省

关系代词
who - 人，主宾 _He is the student (who) I moved to the front._
whom - 人，宾 _The teacher (whom) they love very much will give up teaching._
that - 人，物，主宾表 _Who is the man that teaches you English?_
which - 物，主句，主宾 _She failed the test, which made her worried.(不用as)_
whose - 人，物，定 _We live in a room whose window faces the south._
as: such/the same ... as 指主句，可位于句首，主从语义一致

关系副词(when, where, why)
_This is the factory where he worked last year._
_This is the factory which/that he worked in last year._
_This is the factory where we visited the famous workers last year._
_This is the factory which/that we visited last year._
_This is the factory where cars are made._
_This is the factory which/that makes cars._

the one
_Is this the factory which they visited last year?_
_Is this ~~the~~ factory the one they visited last year?_
_Is this the factory where they worked last year?_
_Is this ~~the~~ factory the one where they worked last year?_

介词问题
固定词组：介词后置，关代灵活
非固定词组：介词前置用which, whom不可省(介词+关代=关副)，介词后置关代灵活
介词词组: _He bought a dictionary with the help of which he could learn English well._
并列句: _He told us to buy __and__ with the help of __it__ we could learn English well._
数词+of: _He has many books, most of which are for students._
代词+of: _The team has eleven memebers, many of whom are useless._

way后定从用in which, that, 或省略

先行词+关代=what: _This is __all that__(what) I want to say._

限制性定从
限制性定从：先行词多个，结构无逗号，翻译在前, 有意义的定语, 影响主句意思（缩小范围）
_This is the house which we bought last month._
_She has a daughter who is a teacher._ 她有一个当教师的女儿。（她可能不只一个女儿）
非限制性定从：先行词一个，结构有逗号，翻译并列句，补充说明的定语, 不影响主句意思
_The house, which we bought last month, is very nice._
_She has a daughter，who is a teacher._ 她有一个女儿，是当教师的。（她只有一个女儿）
在限制性定从中，如果介词不在前，作用是主宾表，用that
先行词被最高级，序数词，不定代词，本身是不定代词，very(正是)修饰，用that

but = which(that, who) ... not, 引导定从，主句为否定句: _There is no rule but has exceptions. There is no rule which has no exceptions._

and that/and ... at that = 而且: _Peter works as an engineer, and hard-working at that._

which/as
从句的谓语动词是主动语态，用which作主语
从句的谓语动词是被动语态，用as作主语
_School will be break up next week, as __has been__ said._

### 副词从句
when可表示"尽管"，"既然": _He walked when he might take a taxi._

only if/if only
only if: 只有在...条件下，后面主语要部分倒装
if only: 要是...就好了，表示愿望，后常用虚拟语气
_Only if it rains, does the river overflow._
_If only I knew what you wanted!_

just as ..., so 正如...一样: _Just as radar is to planes, so eyes are to human's body._

in case
in case 在句首，表如果；在句中，表"以防"
in case 引导从句: should+原形(should不可省)，或者陈述句
lest(以防)引导: (should)+原形 _We dare not play jokes on him lest he should become angry._


## 虚拟语气
||从句|主句|
|-|-|-|
|与现实情况相反|一般过去时(be一律用were)|would(should), could, might + 动词原形|
|将来不太可能的假设|一般过去时(be一律用were), should + 动词原形, were to + 动词原形|would(should), could, might + 动词原形|
|与过去事实相反|had + 过去分词|would(should), could, might + have + 过去分词|

条件从句中用should(were to)+动词原形，表示可能性小，但也不是完全没有，主句不一定用虚拟语气，而用陈述语气或祈使语气
_If she were to call, __tell__ her to wait._
_If I should meet him, __I'll make__ him pay off debt._

根据句子内容，虚拟条件主从句时间可能不一致，要注意时间状语
_If he __had followed__ the doctor's advice, he __would be__ all right __now__._
_If I __were__ you, I __would have gone__ dancing __last night__._

_Whether she is married or not, she is a good worker. = Whether she be married or not, ... = Be she married or not, ..._

It's (hight/about) (不用a/the) time (that) 从句谓语动词用过去式，或should+do，不直接加原形
_It's hight time that we started(should start)._

It is(was) + adj. + that + ... (should) + 原形，adj.常用有necessary, essential, natural, important, proper, arrange, 表建议，敦促，劝告，命令等意

if only和lest引导条件句要用虚拟语气(should+原形)

would rather, had rather, might as well(不妨), would as soon表示对未来的推测，后面接省掉that的从句，谓语用过去时
_To be frank, I'd rather (that) you were not involved in the case._

expect, believe, think, suspect表惊奇，怀疑，不满等词，否定或疑问形式宾从中用(should)+原形
_We never thought that she should be the brave girl._

# Pronunciation
## 辅音l
单词末尾的/l/音与紧邻单词开头的元音<u>连读</u>，后一个单词的重音清楚地__重读__。
_I’m sure you’<u>ll e</u>n**joy** this community service, and you’ll gain valuab<u>le e</u>x**pe**rience at the same time._

如果以/l/结束的单词后面跟着的单词的第一个音节就是被重读的，那么就整个/l+元音/都会被重读。
_rea**<u>l au</u>**dio_ /ri-ˈlɔ:-diəʊ/
_Professor Dodge wi<u>**ll a**</u>ct as a mentor to the tutor._

## 辅音t, d与s
/t/和/d/在后面接着一个辅音的情况下，往往会产生所谓的“失爆”（不是省略，而是略作停顿,在语流中依然占据它们原本该拥有的长度）。
_I hope you’ve all finishe~~d~~ reading the assigne~~d~~ chapter on insurance — so tha~~t~~ you’re prepare~~d~~ for our discussion today._
_You education majors migh~~t~~ be /mai(-)bi:/ especially interested in i~~t~~ because it offers the opportunity to do some teaching — that is, tutoring in math and English._

/t/省略
t+ly: lately, exactly, definitely, absolutely, completely
n后面：aren't, weren't, can't
s后面(t后无元音)：just, best, last, first, must
t+元音+n：eaten, curtain, written, mountain, important
句子结尾：I can do that.

可能产生失爆的辅音还有/p/、/b/、/k/、/g/。
_A new community program called “One On One” hel~~p~~s elementary students who’ve fallen behind._
_It loo~~k~~s good on your resume, too…_

/t/和/d/后面接的辅音是/s/，那么便要演化出/ts/和/dz/的音，音似拼音/ci/, /zi/。
_students_

/d/在/p/和/sh/之后会被读成/t/。

/t/如果夹在两个元音中间，往往会被“浊化”（像短促的/d/）。
_You education majors might be especially interested in it because <u>it o</u>ffers the opportun<u>ity</u> to do some teaching — th<u>at i</u>s, t<u>uto</u>ring in math and English._

/s/后面的轻辅音/t/、/k/、/p/、/ʧ/要浊化（变成/d/, /g/, /b/, /g/）。
_study /sdʌdɪ/, sky /sgaɪ/, experience /ɪksˈbɪərəns/, school /sgu:l/, strive /sʤaɪv/ _
extent, extension /ɪkˈsdenʃ(ə)n/

有些轻辅音之前尽管有/s/，但这些辅音与后面的元音并未构成重音音节的时候，就不会被浊化。
_distance, costume, biscuit_

/t + j/可能会变成/ʧ/
_Then tonight I wan<u>t y</u>ou to go home and read a passage into a tape recorder and evaluate your own voice._
_I hope you’ve all finished reading the assigned chapter on insurance — so tha~~t~~ you’re prepared for our discussion today. _（不变，而是失爆）

/d + j/可能会变成/ʤ/
/s + j/可能会变成/ʃ/


## 强读和弱读
一个英文单词如果由多个音节构成，那么其中至少有一个音节是重音；一个句子由多个单词构成，那么其中总是有至少一个单词被强读，其它的单词会被弱读。

弱读：

* 长元音会变得短一些（几乎与短元音的长度相当）
* 重音音节会变得与非重音音阶一样轻
* 很多元音都会发生变化，向/ə/靠拢
* 轻辅音/s/、/t/、/k/、/f/之后的元音/ə/可能会直接被省略掉
